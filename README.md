# code-insights

Trying to automate code/vcs analysis [inpired by code-maat](admin.doris.bewernitz.net) and the book [Your code as a crime scene](https://pragprog.com/book/atcrime/your-code-as-a-crime-scene).

The draft plan is build a stack with lot's of small tools to utilize EventSourcing to derive the different ways of analysis descried in the talk/book.

**Feel free to add Issues as questios or review any open PRs.**
